### Speech therapist assistant turned backend dev. I used to write IEPs — now I write Python. Still fixing problems nobody else wants to touch..

##### I didn't break into tech through a traditional route. Instead, I built my own way in by solving real-world problems.

##### While experimenting with Fiverr and selling FASTAPI-based APIs (shoutout to Arjan), I was approached by a business that needed more than just an API—it needed a full data pipeline. I solo-engineered and now maintain a system that connects two CRMs with no shared keys, using 3–6 API calls per record to reconcile and transfer data accurately.

##### By day, I work in speech therapy, which is incredibly rewarding. I’ve built internal tools to automate tedious tasks like extracting IEP goals from PDFs and auto-generating folders and documents, complete with a GUI. This saves hours of work and keeps treatment focused and efficient.

##### Now I’m bringing all of this together into a production-ready electronic medical record system built in Django. Backend is running—next up: either a frontend or an offline GUI interface. We'll see.

##### For now: I engineer pipelines, automate my clinical work, and build tools that make hard jobs easier.
